## Introduction

**Digitomize** is designed to provide developers with a comprehensive platform for exploring coding contests and creating dynamic portfolios that showcase their coding skills and achievements.

## Features

- **Contests Section:** Explore upcoming coding contests from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, and more. Filter contests based on various criteria and view contest details such as remaining time, duration, and more.

- **User Profiles:** Create your developer portfolio by providing user handles for different coding platforms. The platform dynamically fetches and displays your updated ratings, achievements, and coding history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/digitomize.git`
2. Install project dependencies and start the development environment: <br>
   a. In the root directory of the project (where package.json is located), run `npm install`. <br>
   b. Install backend and client dependencies together by `npm run installer`. <br>
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend and client directories respectively, and set up the required environment variables such as database connection details, API keys, and other configurations.
- Check [Backend README](/backend/README.md) and [Cliend README](/client/README.md) for more info.
4. Start the development environment: `npm run dev` (This command, defined in your project's package.json, starts both the backend server and the client using the concurrently library. It's a convenient way to run both parts of your application concurrently during development.)

## Usage

### Contests Section

- Visit the **Contests** page to explore upcoming coding contests.
- Apply filters to narrow down contests based on your preferences.
- Click on a contest to view detailed information, including start time, duration, and platform.

### User Profiles

- Create your developer portfolio by signing up and providing your user handles for different coding platforms.
- The platform dynamically fetches and displays your latest ratings, achievements, and contest history.
- Customize your portfolio to display the information you want to share with others.

## Introduction

**Digitomize** is designed to provide developers with a comprehensive platform for exploring coding contests and creating dynamic portfolios that showcase their coding skills and achievements.

## Features

- **Contests Section:** Explore upcoming coding contests from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, and more. Filter contests based on various criteria and view contest details such as remaining time, duration, and more.

- **User Profiles:** Create your developer portfolio by providing user handles for different coding platforms. The platform dynamically fetches and displays your updated ratings, achievements, and coding history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB
- ⭐ (hehe star the repo)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/digitomize.git`
2. Install project dependencies and start the development environment: <br>
   a. In the root directory of the project (where package.json is located), run `npm install`. <br>
   b. Install backend and client dependencies together by `npm run installer`. <br>
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend and client directories respectively, and set up the required environment variables such as database connection details, API keys, and other configurations.
4. Start the development environment: `npm run dev` (This command, defined in your project's package.json, starts both the backend server and the client using the concurrently library. It's a convenient way to run both parts of your application concurrently during development.)

## Usage

### Contests Section

- Visit the **Contests** page to explore upcoming coding contests.
- Apply filters to narrow down contests based on your preferences.
- Click on a contest to view detailed information, including start time, duration, and platform.

### User Profiles

- Create your developer portfolio by signing up and providing your user handles for different coding platforms.
- The platform dynamically fetches and displays your latest ratings, achievements, and contest history.
- Customize your portfolio to display the information you want to share with others.

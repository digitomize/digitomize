## Folder Structure

The backend folder is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:
```bash
/backend
  /contest
    /controllers   # Logic for handling API requests related to contests
    /models        # Database models for contests
    /routes        # API route definitions for contests
  /user
    /controllers   # Logic for handling API requests related to users
    /models        # Database models for users
    /routes        # API route definitions for users
    /middlewares   # Custom middleware functions specific to users
    /services      # Reusable services and utilities specific to users
  index.js         # Main server file
```

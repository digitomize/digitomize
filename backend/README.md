## Folder Structure

The backend folder is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

```bash
.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/digitomize.git`
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd digitomize/backend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Environment Variables

 Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file using `npm run setup` (_Recommended_).

## Creating a `.env` from the `npm run setup`

- Move To backend directory.
- Run `npm run setup`
- Fill in the details for `.env` or use Default values if Provided.

## Creating a `.env` from the `.example.env` file template

- Create a new `.env` file in the backend directory
- Copy the contents of the `.example.env` in the backend directory and paste them into your created `.env` file
- Fill in the `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=` variable in JSON with the JSON credentials generated from your created firebase project (see below for instructions on how to get these credentials)

#### Example:

```bash
TEST=Env file connected.
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/digitomize
PORT=4001
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4001
CONTESTS=true
USERS=true
NODE_ENV=development

# Firebase Configuration
`FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=` # you need to add JSON for this
```

### The Environment Variables in `.env`

This `.env` file must be populated with the following environment variables for digitomize to work:

| Variable              | Explanation                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TEST                  | Marker indicating that the environment file is successfully connected.                                 |
| MONGODB_URL           | URL for connecting Digitomize to the MongoDB database. |
| PORT                  | Port on which the application will run.                                                                |
| BACKEND_URL           | URL of the backend server.                                                                             |
| CONTESTS              | Controls whether the application should fetch contest data.                                            |
| USERS                 | Controls whether the application should fetch user data.                                               |
| NODE_ENV              | Specifies the environment in which the application is running.                                          |
| FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS | Variable intended for storing Firebase credential in JSON format.                               |

## Linking MongoDB
To connect Digitomize to the database side, two options are available: MongoDB atlas or hosting a local instance. Here is a setup guide on both options.

### Setting up Atlas
1. **Sign Up/Login to MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Create a New Cluster**:
   - Once logged in, click on the "Build a Cluster" button or navigate to the "Clusters" tab and click on "Build a New Cluster".
   - Choose the provider and region for your cluster. For example, you can select a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) and a region closest to your location.
   - Select the desired cluster tier (e.g., M0 Sandbox is the free tier).
   - Click "Create Cluster" to provision your new cluster.

3. **Configure Cluster Settings**:
   - MongoDB Atlas will guide you through the process of setting up your cluster. You can keep the default settings or customize them based on your requirements.
   - Choose the cluster name, project name, and other settings as needed.

4. **Whitelist Your IP Address**:
   - In the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the "Network Access" tab.
   - Click on the "Add IP Address" button and add your current IP address to the whitelist. This allows your application to connect to the cluster.

5. **Get Connection String**:
   - Once your cluster is created, click on the "Connect" button.
   - Choose "Connect Your Application" and select your driver and version.
   - Copy the connection string provided.

6. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - Paste the following content into your `.env` file:

     ```plaintext
     MONGODB_URL=<connection-string>
     ```

   - Replace `<connection-string>` with the MongoDB Atlas connection string you copied earlier.

7. **Save the `.env` File**:
   - Save the changes to the `.env` file.
  
### Setting up Locally
To use MongoDB locally, you need to first download MongoDB locally and then update the `.env` file.

### How to download MongoDB

1. **Download MongoDB**:
   - Visit the [official MongoDB download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and select the appropriate version for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.

2. **Install MongoDB**:
   - For Windows:
     - Run the downloaded installer (.msi file) and follow the setup wizard.
     - Choose the Complete installation type and proceed with the installation.
   - For macOS:
     - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the MongoDB application to the Applications folder.
   - For Linux:
     - Follow the installation instructions specific to your Linux distribution provided on the MongoDB download page.

3. **Start MongoDB Server**:
   - Open a command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the MongoDB bin directory.
   - Start the MongoDB server by running the `mongod` command:
     ```
     mongod
     ```
   - MongoDB should now be running locally on the default port (27017) unless configured otherwise.

4. **Verify MongoDB Installation**:
   - Open a new CLI window and navigate to the MongoDB bin directory.
   - Run the `mongo` command to open the MongoDB shell.
   - If MongoDB is running properly, you should see a prompt indicating that you've connected to the MongoDB server.
### Update the `.env`:
      MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/digitomize
    
## Firebase Credentials

To get credentials you should first have a firebase project. If you don't know how to make one, please check [Frontend Documentation](/client/README.md).

- Select your project.
- Go to "Project Settings" by clicking on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" in the top-left corner.
- Navigate to the "Service accounts" tab.
- If you haven't created a service account yet, click on "Generate new private key."
- This will generate a new service account key and automatically download it as a JSON file (`serviceAccountKey.json`). it will look something like this

  ```json
  {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourPrivateKey\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account-email%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  }
  ```

- copy this entire thing and set it as the value of FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS in your .env file. (Make sure the entire json is placed on a single line)

### Running the Server

Start the server: `npm start`

### Linting
- Run `npm run lint` to check for errors using the linter.
- Run `npm run lint-fix` to have the linter automatically fix errors where possible.

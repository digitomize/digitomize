# Digitomize - Client

Welcome to the client-side documentation for Digitomize, an open-source platform that combines two main sections: Contests and User Profiles. This documentation covers the structure of the client-side codebase and provides information on how to get started.

## Project Structure

The client directory is organized into several main directories and components:

```bash
.
└── /client/
    └── /src/
        ├── /assets         # Static assets like images and fonts
        ├── /components     # Reusable React components/
        │   ├── /AuthButtons
        │   ├── /Contests/
        │   │   └── /Challenges
        │   ├── /Home

```

- `assets`: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other files used in your application's user interface.

- `components`: Reusable React components are stored here. These components can be used throughout your application to maintain consistency and modularity.

- `context`: This directory contains context providers and related utility functions for state management.

- `core`: Houses core functionalities or services used throughout your application like API services, modals or other essential utilities.

- `dsaSheets`: Contains components, implementations, or utilities related to DSA content.

- `lib`: This directory stores additional libraries or utility functions that are used across your application.

- `pages`: Organized React components that represent different pages or views in your application.

- `user`: Contains components and functionality related to user profiles.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm

# Installation

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digitomize/digitomize.git
```

- Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd digitomize/client
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

# Configuration

By running `npm run setup`, you can quickly and easily set up environment variables for your client and backend directory respectively without the hassle of manual configuration.Move to directory e.g backend and run as follows _(You can use Default Values wherever Provided)_:
```bash
npm run setup
```

_Fill the empty fields by creating a demo firebase project._

## Steps To Set Up Environment Variables (_Recommended_).

- Move to the client directory using `cd client` on Terminal.
- Run the `npm run setup` command.
- Fill in the empty fields with the values from your firebase project (see below for instructions on how to create a firebase project)
_You can use Default Values Wherever Provided_

#### Creating New firebase project and setting up .env variables

- Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Create an account if you don't have one and click on get started
- Add a project
- Add an app and select web as the platform
- Once you register your app you'll get a prompt to add firebase SDK to your app
- In that propt you'll see a const variable called firebaseConfig which will contain all your config info it will look something like this. (these are just dummy values)

  ```javascript
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "IKNdsaKsdabdGL5iuywrfHUIKBubkjbJGDfIBHUGnkjVA",
    authDomain: "sample-u78nb.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "sample-u78nb",
    storageBucket: "sample-u78nb.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "872459742932",
    appId: "9:872459742932:web:&8ufnhjbhbj89nu8b",
    measurementId: "G-YTUTY89kFT",
  };
  ```

- Use these values to populate your .env file

# Usage

The client-side codebase is responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the backend API. To run the client application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server. You can then access and interact with the Digitomize client application.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Digitomize project are welcome! If you would like to contribute to the client-side codebase, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to contribute.

### Linting
- Run `npm run lint` to check for errors using the linter.
- Run `npm run lint-fix` to have the linter automatically fix errors where possible.
